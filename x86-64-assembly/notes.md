# Notes

The args as registers in order are `rdi`,`rsi`,`rdx`,`rcx`,`r8`,`r9`. So if a function is being passed two parameters, the second one will be in `rsi`
The return val will be `rax` (eg set this to `0` for false, `1` for true) if a function returns a val.

`idiv` divides `edx:eax` by the val of `ecx`, and puts the result in `eax` with the remainder in `edx`

`rep` repeats whatever instruction follows it by the number in `ecx/rcx` (each repeat decrements `ecx` until it is `0`)

`movsb` moves a byte from the *address* referenced by `esi` to the *address* referenced by `rdi`, then increments both (moving the address forward to the next byte). Useful for concatting strings

# Compiling and Debugging

Debugging can be done using IDA Freeware.

## Option 1: compiling with test cases

To compile asm with all the tests in exercism do as such (for windows):

```nasm -f win64 -o binary-search.o binary_search.asm && gcc.exe binary-search.o binary_search_test.c vendor/*.c vendor/*.h -o win.exe```

This can then be debugged with ida. Optionally Ida may ask for the c class files to show the c code, but you can switch back to assembly as needed in a different tab

## Option 2: compiling alone

Assembly requires a few directives to become a win exe. For example, assuming single function is 'distance' (from the hamming challenge) and takes two args, add initial code like so:

```assembly
default rel
section .rodata
arg1: db "GGACGGATTCTG", 0  ; used for this specific function
arg2: db "AGGACGGATTCT", 0

section .text
global main                 ; key parts to add from here...
main:
    lea rsi, [arg1]
    lea rdi, [arg2]
    call distance
    ret                     ; to here
distance:
                            ; rest of code. remove original 'global distance'
```

then compile to a executable that can be opened with ida as so (assuming assembly is named `hamming.asm`):

```nasm -f win64 -o win.obj hamming.asm && gcc.exe win.obj -o win.exe```

(note the above is done using wsl, which can run windows exes like gcc.exe)

To do the equiv on linux (and use gdb or r2 or whatever):

```nasm -f elf64 -o lin.o hamming.asm && ld -o lin lin.o && ./lin```
